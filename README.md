# 🚀 DevOps CI/CD Project 🔧

Welcome to the **DevOps CI/CD Project** repository! This project demonstrates how to build and implement a fully automated **CI/CD pipeline** using various DevOps tools and best practices. The pipeline streamlines development, automates testing, and ensures smooth deployment of applications into production environments.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project utilizes modern tools and practices to automate the entire development and deployment process. **Please follow the documentation provided** to set up your own infrastructure and pipeline from scratch.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

- ☁️ **AWS**: Cloud platform for infrastructure provisioning and scaling.
- 🏗️ **Terraform**: Automating infrastructure creation using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- 🐙 **GitHub**: Version control and source code management.
- 🛠️ **Jenkins**: CI/CD automation server for continuous integration and deployment.
- 📈 **Prometheus & Grafana**: Monitoring and visualizing system performance metrics.

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline Overview

This project covers the complete **CI/CD pipeline** lifecycle, from development to production deployment:

1. **Source Code Management**: 
   - GitHub integration for source code management and version control.
2. **Automated Builds**:
   - Jenkins triggers builds automatically upon code commits.
   - **Maven** for compiling, building, and packaging applications.
3. **Automated Testing**:
   - Jenkins integrates with testing tools to automatically run unit tests and code quality checks (SonarQube).
4. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - **Prometheus** monitors application performance.
   - **Grafana** visualizes metrics and provides dashboards for real-time insights.

## 📑 Repository Structure

- 📂 `src/`: Source code of the application.
- 📄 `Jenkinsfile`: Configuration for Jenkins pipeline.
- ⚙️ `Terraform/`: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations for AWS resources.
- 📝 `README.md`: This file with an overview of the project.

## 💻 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DandySabrrish1999/ttrend.git
Infrastructure Setup:

Use Terraform to provision the required AWS infrastructure.
Follow the documentation to set up EC2 instances and other necessary components:
bash
Copy code
terraform apply
Set Up Jenkins and Configure Pipelines:

Use Jenkins to configure and manage your CI/CD pipeline as outlined in the documentation.
Monitor Application:

Set up Prometheus and Grafana following the documentation for monitoring:
Access Grafana dashboards for real-time insights into your infrastructure.
📊 Monitoring and Logging
Prometheus is configured to monitor system health and performance metrics.
Grafana dashboards are available to visualize key metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and request rates.
📖 Conclusion
This project is a complete guide to building, deploying, and monitoring applications in a fully automated DevOps environment. You can follow the detailed documentation provided to set up your own infrastructure and run the pipeline independently.
